# Some sample analyses 

At the 2017 RStudio Conference, Jenny Bryan cited the advantage of
keeping the markdown files knit from .Rmd files and uploading them
to the repository **instead of** .html files. By choosing the
`github_md` variant of markdown, Jenny claimed the rendering was
more helpful for those who visit the repository. Here I test that
idea. I set this up with tow of the vignettes from my `rEDS`
package.
